         <h2>MKG – Milwaukee</h2><br>
      <p>
        MKG – Milwaukee is the local chapter of the Minnesota Kali Group, brought to access the Milwaukee area through the shared home of The Lyceum. Under the guidance of experienced instructors, MKG emphasizes Filipino martial arts, Jeet Kune Do principles, Thai Kickboxing and blended graplling arts systems. From stick and blade to empty-hand fluidity, the system is designed for real-world connection and personal growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        At MKG – Milwaukee our training philosophy aligns closely with The Lyceum’s commitment to intentional, practice-rich sessions. We offer private lessons, small group labs, and open training hours where students of varying levels can refine instinct, timing, and movement together. Instead of rigid curriculum blocks and belt ranks, students progress by understanding how techniques relate to body, partner, mind, and context.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you are stepping into weapon drills for the first time or integrating advanced empty-hand strategies, MKG – Milwaukee welcomes the curious, the committed, and the collaborative. As part of The Lyceum community, you’ll benefit from multiple teachers, cross-discipline insights, and a culture of shared learning. The aim is not simply to train harder but to train smarter, together.
