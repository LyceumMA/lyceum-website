        <h2>Ergo Vita Martial Arts</h2><br>

      <p>
        <strong>Ergo Vita Martial Arts</strong> is dedicated to cultivating strength, awareness, and longevity through mindful movement. 
        Rooted in the arts of <strong>Wing Chun</strong> and <strong>Tai Chi</strong>, the program blends traditional martial principles with modern understanding of fitness and health. 
        Training emphasizes efficiency, structure, and adaptability — developing both external skill and internal stability. 
        Through these practices, students explore how power and calm can coexist, and how disciplined movement can support a balanced life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each session integrates martial technique with functional fitness and meditative awareness. 
        Wing Chun provides direct, practical methods for structure, timing, and close-range efficiency, while Tai Chi cultivates flow, coordination, and mindful intent. 
        Sessions may include strength and mobility training, partner drills, breath work, and guided meditation — creating a complete approach that nurtures the body, focuses the mind, and restores energy.
      </p>

      <p>
        At its core, Ergo Vita is about <em>living movement</em> — training not just for combat or performance, but for the long-term health of body and spirit. 
        Whether you seek precision and discipline through Wing Chun, mindfulness and vitality through Tai Chi, or the grounding calm of meditation and breath, 
        Ergo Vita offers a space to train with intention and explore how movement can enrich every part of life.
