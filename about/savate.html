       <h2>Milwaukee Savate Club</h2><br>

      <p>
        <strong>Milwaukee Savate Club</strong> is devoted to the study and practice of <strong>French Kickboxing</strong>, 
        a martial art known for its elegance, precision, and tactical intelligence. 
        At The Lyceum, the Savate program explores the balance between artistry and practicality — 
        combining Western boxing fundamentals with the dynamic kicking techniques that define this refined combat sport. 
        Each session emphasizes clean technique, fluid footwork, and the ability to adapt under pressure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Training at Milwaukee Savate Club focuses on the science of movement. 
        Students learn to control distance, timing, and angles with purpose and efficiency. 
        Workouts blend technical drills, conditioning, and controlled sparring to build coordination, speed, and endurance. 
        The result is a training experience that challenges both the body and the mind — cultivating calm awareness and creative problem solving through motion.
      </p>

      <p>
        While Savate is a striking art at its core, it is also a practice of discipline and respect. 
        Classes are structured yet approachable, welcoming anyone interested in learning the beauty and precision of this European art form. 
        As part of The Lyceum’s collaborative environment, Milwaukee Savate Club offers students the opportunity to cross-train, 
        discover new perspectives, and appreciate how different martial systems can complement one another. 
        Whether for fitness, skill development, or the love of movement itself, Savate offers a pathway to growth through strategy and grace.
