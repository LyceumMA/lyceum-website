          <h2>A collaborative space for martial artists and teachers.</h2><br>

        <p>
          The Lyceum is a shared training space and collective of martial artists based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
          It operates as a cooperative environment rather than a traditional school, providing a home for multiple independent programs to coexist and grow together. 
          Currently, it serves as the base for <strong>Ergo Vita Martial Arts</strong>, <strong>MKG Milwaukee</strong>, and <strong>Milwaukee Savate Club</strong> — 
          each with its own specialty, teaching style, and community of students. 
          The Lyceum connects these groups through a common philosophy of open-minded training, respect for tradition, and a spirit of collaboration.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rather than offering fixed schedules or tiered programs, The Lyceum provides a flexible model for learning. 
          Training happens through private lessons, small group sessions, and open training hours where practitioners come together to share ideas and refine skills. 
          These are not classes in the conventional sense but opportunities for exploration — guided by conversation, personal goals, and mutual respect. 
          This format allows each person to shape their own martial path while still engaging with a wider community of teachers and peers.
        </p>

        <h3>The people behind The Lyceum.</h3><br>

        <p>
          The Lyceum was founded by <strong>Jim Guarnaccio</strong>, <strong>Nick Wintergerst</strong>, and <strong>Ben Bridwell</strong> — 
          three lifelong martial artists with a shared desire to create a space centered on learning, not hierarchy. 
          Each founder brings years of experience across diverse disciplines including Jeet Kune Do Concepts, Kali, Tai Chi, Wing Chun, Muay Thai, Savate, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. 
          Together, they built The Lyceum to reflect a simple idea: that martial arts thrive when practiced in community, where curiosity and creativity lead the way.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Lyceum continues to grow as a place for honest practice and shared exploration. 
          It welcomes instructors and students who see martial arts as both a craft and a dialogue — 
          a lifelong pursuit that challenges the body, sharpens the mind, and connects people across traditions. 
          Whether you visit for a single session or make it your training home, The Lyceum exists to help you move, think, and grow with purpose.
