        <h3>A shared home for practice, movement, and collaboration.</h3> <br>
        <p>
          The Lyceum Martial Arts Group is a place to explore movement and martial art. 
          It is home to such as <strong>MKG Milwaukee</strong>, <strong>Ergo Vita Tai Chi</strong>, 
          and <strong>Milwauke Savate Club</strong> and others. We share in and develop through arts like 
          <strong>Kali</strong>, <strong>Wing Chun</strong>, <strong>Muay Thai</strong>, 
          <strong>Savate</strong>, and the <strong>Grappling Arts</strong>. 
          Together, we blend tradition with innovation and build a community rooted in curiosity, 
          respect, and open exchange.
        </p>

        <h3>Purposeful training and personal connection.</h3><br>
        <p>
          At Lyceum, we do not host classes in the traditional sense. Instead, we explore learning on your terms through private lessons and small group sessions that are tailored to your goals. Our open training times are not classes but shared practice sessions, shaped by the intentions of those present. Each meeting is an opportunity to explore relationships between body, partner, mind, and the arts we study — learning from one another and adapting what we find to fit each person’s path. The result is a practice that feels both personal and connected, guided by curiosity and collaboration rather than rigid structure.
        </p>

        <h3>Curiosity over conformity. Discovery over repetition.</h3><br>
        <p>
          We study and share the arts for growth, defense, and development. 
          Training here emphasizes learning through collaboration and honest exploration. 
          The Lyceum exists to honor tradition, innovate method, and cultivate people — 
          creating a space where martial artists can train, connect, and continue the conversation together.
